      <p style={{marginTop:"0px"}}>Under each PPC &amp; SEM plan, you're only committed to paying the monthly management fee (with the exception of pilot campaigns). New campaigns and channels are separate line items to be purchased as needed. This model ensures you'll never overpay for a service you don't need. While you may pay more upfront, you'll see greater savings in the long run as your campaigns mature. See here for more on how this approach compares to <Link to="/">other agency pricing models.</Link></p>
      <h3>What's included in the management fee?</h3>
      <p>The management fee covers everything needed to maintain your campaigns over time. All campaigns are optimized through A/B testing, ad rotation, bid adjustments, ad scheduling, negative keywords and more. I scour the ad landscape for risks and opportunities so you don't have to. My goal is to turn every campaign into a stream of leads that holds steady even in the face of significant changes. The fee also includes weekly reporting and friendly support via email or phone.</p>

      <h3>What's a pilot campaign?</h3>
      <p>A pilot campaign is a test run. It's the simplest possible campaign we can run to learn whether paid ads will work for your business. It's an affordable way to test the waters without committing to anything long-term. Once the campaign ends, you'll know what it costs to acquire a lead, how likely your leads are to convert, and more. <Link to="/">See here</Link> for full details.</p>
      <h3>What's a new campaign?</h3>
      <p>A "new campaign" contains everything you need to advertise a product or service for which you haven't previously ran ads. New campaigns include keyword research, audience definition, ad creative, and landing page design. If you want to advertise something that doesn't already have these assets, you'll need a new campaign to do it.</p>
      <h3>What does it mean to deploy an existing campaign to a new channel?</h3>
      <p>This is when you take an ad campaign thatâ€™s already running on one channel and adapt it to run on another channel. E.G., using an existing Google campaign as the basis to build Facebook ads for the same product or service.</p>
